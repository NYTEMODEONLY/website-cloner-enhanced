## Planned Improvements

### High Priority
- [ ] Add depth limiting option to control crawl depth
- [ ] Implement proper handling of JavaScript-rendered content
- [ ] Add resume capability for interrupted downloads
- [ ] Add cookie/session support for authenticated websites
- [ ] Implement robots.txt compliance

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement parallel downloads using async/threading
- [ ] Add user agent rotation to avoid detection
- [ ] Add sitemap support for better discovery
- [ ] Add resource compression options
- [ ] Implement HTML validation

### Lower Priority
- [ ] Add domain filtering options
- [ ] Add custom headers support
- [ ] Add URL pattern filtering
- [ ] Implement proxy support
- [ ] Add configuration file support
- [ ] Add batch processing for multiple websites

## Known Limitations

- Does not handle JavaScript-rendered content (SPA websites)
- No support for authenticated websites requiring login
- May miss dynamically loaded resources not present in initial HTML
- Does not handle form submissions or interactive elements
- Handles only HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- No control over crawl order or prioritization
- May encounter issues with websites using aggressive anti-scraping measures
- No handling of websites that require specific browser features
- May miss resources loaded via WebSocket connections
- No support for websites using CAPTCHA or other human verification

## Implementation Notes

Future improvements should focus on enhancing the tool's flexibility while respecting web scraping ethics. Key priorities:

1. Implement depth limiting to control how deep the crawler goes
2. Add support for JavaScript-rendered content to handle modern websites
3. Add resume capability for interrupted downloads
4. Add cookie/session support for authenticated websites
5. Implement robots.txt compliance for ethical crawling
6. Add user agent rotation to avoid detection
7. Implement parallel downloads for better performance
8. Improve memory management for large websites
9. Add sitemap support for better discovery
10. Implement better URL normalization and handling
