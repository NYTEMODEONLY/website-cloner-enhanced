## Potential Upgrades

### High Priority
- [ ] **Depth Limiting**: Add option to limit crawl depth for partial website cloning
- [ ] **Domain Filtering**: Option to include/exclude specific domains when crawling
- [ ] **Parallel Downloads**: Use async/threading for faster downloads
- [ ] **Resume Capability**: Option to resume interrupted downloads
- [ ] **URL Filtering**: Support regex patterns to include/exclude URLs

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Cookie/Session Handling**: Support for authenticated websites
- [ ] **Custom Headers**: Allow user to specify custom headers for requests
- [ ] **Robots.txt Compliance**: Respect robots.txt directives
- [ ] **Sitemap Support**: Use XML sitemaps to discover pages
- [ ] **Dynamic Content Handling**: Support for JavaScript-rendered content using tools like Selenium
- [ ] **Proxy Support**: Allow use of proxies for requests
- [ ] **Resource Compression**: Option to optimize downloaded resources
- [ ] **Content Type Filtering**: Option to filter by specific content types

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Batch Processing**: Support for cloning multiple websites in sequence
- [ ] **Configuration File**: Support for loading settings from a config file
- [ ] **HTML Validation**: Verify downloaded HTML is valid and complete
- [ ] **Resource Optimization**: Option to minify CSS/JS files
- [ ] **Image Optimization**: Option to compress images while maintaining quality
- [ ] **Cache Control**: Better handling of cache headers and caching
- [ ] **Redirect Handling**: Improved handling of HTTP redirects
- [ ] **SSL/TLS Options**: Configurable SSL/TLS settings for secure connections
- [ ] **User Agent Rotation**: Rotate user agents to avoid detection
- [ ] **Rate Limit Detection**: Detect and adapt to website rate limits
- [ ] **Resource Prioritization**: Prioritize critical resources first
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Optimize memory usage for large websites
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensure consistent behavior across operating systems

## Known Limitations

- Does not handle JavaScript-rendered content (SPA websites)
- No support for authenticated websites requiring login
- May miss dynamically loaded resources not present in initial HTML
- Does not handle form submissions or interactive elements
- Handles only HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- No control over crawl order or prioritization
- Cannot handle some complex relative URLs correctly
- May encounter issues with websites using aggressive anti-scraping measures
- Limited support for websites with complex URL structures
- No handling of websites that require specific browser features
- May miss resources loaded via WebSocket connections
- No support for websites using CAPTCHA or other human verification

## Implementation Notes

### Current Focus
Our unified website cloner now handles both standard websites and template-style websites in a single script:

1. For standard websites:
   - Uses recursive crawling for comprehensive site mapping
   - Follows standard link structure
   - Processes pages breadth-first

2. For template websites:
   - Automatically detects template-style sites
   - Uses specialized handling for relative paths
   - Extracts and downloads assets directly
   - Preserves original directory structure

### Future Priorities

1. Add depth limiting for controlled partial downloads
2. Implement parallel downloading for improved performance
3. Add resume capability for interrupted downloads
4. Improve handling of authenticated websites
5. Add support for dynamic content (JavaScript-rendered pages)
6. Implement better memory management for large websites
7. Improve handling of anti-scraping measures
8. Add support for WebSocket connections
9. Enhance URL normalization and handling
10. Add support for regex-based URL filtering
